# Meeting Notes

## 12/11/24

### Suggestion(s)

- When a user logging in, this user must get a latest authorizations from the database
- Wait for research more about the benefit of DTO and decide whether to take it off or not.
- Change Enum for component permission to use master data table

### Issue(s)

- When login fail, the response show the error stack trace, it should not show, but instead it should show the reason message.
- Add role to user endpoint not working.
